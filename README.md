# BTDA 2025 Tokenization of Carbon credits

We use Hardhat to compile, test and deploy the project. More infos on hardhat: https://hardhat.org/

First, you need to install Hardhat using npm with:
`npm install --save-dev hardhat`.

Then, install npm dependencies:
`npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@latest`.

Now you are ready to go. For compiling the project execute
`npx hardhat compile`.
To run the tests execute
`npx hardhat test`.

There are also some automatically generated files in the project that you can ignore. Only "CarbonNFT"-files are relevant for us at the moment.
